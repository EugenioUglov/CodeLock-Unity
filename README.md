You can set correct code, subscribe methods when calling UnityEvents OnCorrectCodeInputted and OnWrongCodeInputted in DigitalLock.cs.
It is also possible to subscribe to the OnNumberButtonClickEvent in DigitalLockView.cs created using a delegate that is called when any number button on the panel is clicked.
